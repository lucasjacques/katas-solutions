# C++ katas-solutions
My personal solutions for the CodeWars Katas in C++

## Getting Started

These instructions are what you need to get set up to run these solutions

### Prerequisites

This project only requires a C++ compiler to work, so you'll need that to generate an executable (program) from each solution

#### C++ Compiler

I used [this guide to Install C++ compiler in Windows](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-install-c-and-cpp-compiler-on-windows/)

## Running the solutions

1. First you'll need to run the following compiler command from the shell (where `example.cpp` is the target solution and `example.exe` is the executable name)
```$ g++ -o example.exe example.cpp```
